DataURL-Reader

A browser based application to create data URLs from image files.

Open index.html in your browser and drag a small image file (up to 1 MB) to
the indicated drop area. The data URL of this file will be displayed below.

Data URLs are a great way to embed small images in HTML pages without the
need for extra files. Note that since they are base64 encoded a data URL
will be about 1/3 bigger than the original file size.
